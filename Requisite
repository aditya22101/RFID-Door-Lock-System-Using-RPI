 DESIGN AND WORKING PRINCIPLE 
RFID technology utilizes electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to Ras-pi and Servo motor. These tags contain unique identifiers that can 
be read wirelessly by RFID readers. By incorporating RFID technology into door lock systems, it becomes possible to Parts enhance security, streamline access control processes, 
and improve overall convenience.
